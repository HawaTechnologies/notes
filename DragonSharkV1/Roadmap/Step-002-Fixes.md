- [x] I have some __TODO FIX__ and __TODO FEATURE__ entries, in this repository, to fix/improve later. Notably, in files 003.Layout and 004.Services in the Development documentation.
- [x] Also, I need to, again, create a backup of the current state of the storage.
- [ ] Fix and make a new backup: I have a config file named `desmune2015.cfg` in the `.config/retroarch/config` in-home directory. It must be `desmume2025.cfg` instead. Also check the `.emulationstation/es_systems.cfg` (and the template) to have the proper spelling.
