# Many fixes
- [x] I have some __TODO FIX__ and __TODO FEATURE__ entries, in this repository, to fix/improve later. Notably, in files 003.Layout and 004.Services in the Development documentation.
- [x] Also, I need to, again, create a backup of the current state of the storage.
- [x] Fix and make a new backup: I have a config file named `desmune2015.cfg` in the `.config/retroarch/config` in-home directory. It must be `desmume2025.cfg` instead. Also check the `.emulationstation/es_systems.cfg` (and the template) to have the proper spelling.
- [x] I added 4 lines to the device management (`devices.py`) in Hawa-Virtualpad server to remap the buttons NESW=0123 to become SEWN=0123. I need these lines to be in the virtualpad-server in the DragonShark console.
- [x] Check/Learn: Who's the owner of /mnt/SAVES? While games are run under the `gamer` profile... can `pi` modify the /mnt/SAVES directory (this, in order to make a **restore** from a backup.zip file).
    - Confirmed: It's `pi`. And the owner of `CURRENT_SAVE` is `gamer`. And the one who saves and loads is, in the end, the launcher process with root privilege.
    - So the lack of other-read / group-read permissions is not a problem here.
    - Also, `pi` is the owner for direct access to `SAVES` directory. This makes no problem for stuff like RetroArch / EmulationStation.
- [x] VirtualPad: When a control is kicked, the connection must be TERMINATED, and it must reflect in the client as well.
- [ ] Again, make a backup from Dragonshark console into my development card.
