# System Setup : Software and Utilities

This document describes extra software that is needed on top of the base system to work for the purpose
of being a video games console. Two sections will exist in this document:

1. The external software (typically, for emulated games) that is installed on top of the Raspbian image,
   and is maintained by the community and typically supported as a package in the Raspbian repositories.
2. The Hawa-provided custom utilities, developed for this video games console.

## Well-known software

### Web Browsers

A `chromium-browser` is installed. This is installed to run HTML5 games.

### Box86 and Box64

Both `box86` and `box64` are meant to execute native Linux games in those architectures. Installing `box86`
also required adding the `ia32` architecture to the system.

### Python

Python 3.9 is supported as a global interpreter (`python`). This comes out-of-the-box in Raspbian, and
the system can be upgraded to add newer versions if needed.

## RetroArch and EmulationStation

RetroArch is installed (N64 games are not supported) as a libretro-bridging emulator. Also, EmulationStation
(`emulationstation`) is installed.

In addition, 20 libretro cores were built and installed to emulate many well-known retro consoles up to
Nintendo 64 and Nintendo DS (does not include consoles like PlayStation 2, Nintendo GameCube or newer).

The supported consoles for emulation are:

- Atari 2600.
- Atari 5200.
- Atari 7800.
- Atari Jaguar.
- Atari Lynx.
- DOS Box.
- SEGA Genesis.
- SEGA Game Gear.
- SEGA Master System.
- SEGA CD.
- Nintendo (NES).
- Nintendo (SNES).
- Nintendo Gameboy Color (supports B/W Gameboy games as well).
- Nintendo Gameboy Advance.
- Nintendo DS.
- Nintendo 64.
- MAME.
- Sony PlayStation.
- NeoGeo CD.
- NeoGeo Pocket.
