# System Setup : Useful Commands

Commands described here relate to the process of developing and maintaining the image, and also for end users to some
extent (in-production useful commands for end users).

## Install, backup and restore

The following commands can be used to create the initial installation of the console, a backup of the console, and also
a restore of a backup into the console. These commands assume certain names or indices, so users must double-check
everything before executing them, or they might lose their data and have to start over.

This works with any image compatible with the ARM64 architecture for Banana Pi M5 but, for the sake of this console, it
must be the Raspbian Image described in [this page](002.System-001-OS-Structure.md).

### Install / Restore

The instructions here are the same whether it's a first install or it's a restore over an existing install (full wipe
of the existing system).

First, install requires an external SD card to be burned with the image to use (development or production, it doesn't
matter by this point). By this point, nothing is burned in the eMMC and, in fact, that's the goal of this step.

The first thing to do is recognize the available storage devices:

```shell
fdisk -l
```

Showing like this:

```
Disk /dev/mmcblk0: ...storage size info...
Units: ...
Sector size (logical/physical): ...
I/O size (minimum/optimal): ...
Disklabel type: ...
Disk identifier: ...

Device Boot Start End Sectors Size Id  Type
...    ...  ...   ... ...     ...  ... ...

Disk /dev/mmcblk1: ...storage size info...
Units: ...
Sector size (logical/physical): ...
I/O size (minimum/optimal): ...
Disklabel type: ...
Disk identifier: ...

Device Boot Start End Sectors Size Id  Type
...    ...  ...   ... ...     ...  ... ...
```

_Two_ disks, one standing for the SD card and one for the internal disk. Check the sizes, considering the eMMC has
almost 16 GB of storage, and the SD card will vary (you might notice other details, especially if the SD card has
also almost 16 GB of storage: check which unit has a big bunch of used space, and that one will be the SD card -
however, typically the `/dev/mmcblk0` will be the SD card by this point, since the system was booted from the SD
card).

With this in mind, it's just a matter of burning the current SD card system into the eMMC, like this:

```shell
sudo dd if=/dev/mmcblk0 of=/dev/mmcblk1 bs=4M status=progress
```

_Double check this, since I'm assuming `/dev/mmcblk0` stands for the SD Card and `/dev/mmcblk1` stands for the
eMMC device_.

Alternatively, if the SD card is big enough and has more things and more partitions, perhaps it's the case for
an image to exist by this point, inside one or more of the partitions. For example, let's say that the SD card
has a partition named `/media/pi/BigOne` with an image file named `mmcblk0_backup.img` having the system to be
installed. This command, in that situation, works:

```shell
sudo dd if=/media/pi/BigOne/mmcblk0_backup.img of=/dev/mmcblk1 bs=4M status=progress
```

_Again: Double check this, since I'm assuming `/dev/mmcblk0` stands for the SD Card and `/dev/mmcblk1` stands
for the eMMC device_.

Finally, that command can also be done if not starting from the SD card! It's somewhat risky to do this, since
the device being written in this case is the eMMC while, at the same time, the eMMC is running its own system
and writing its own files, and something might be corrupted in the middle. **Do this with caution**. The command
is the same one, but for `/dev/mmcblk0`.

```shell
sudo dd if=/media/pi/BigOne/mmcblk0_backup.img of=/dev/mmcblk0 bs=4M status=progress
```

With this, the next step to have this working is:

1. Shutdown the console (e.g. unplug, or gracefully shut down the OS).
2. Remove the SD card.
3. Start the console.

The new system should be working.

### Backup

The backup is the converse operation. It is only needed:

1. A system to exist in the eMMC storage.
2. The target SD card in the SD card slot, with enough AVAILABLE space (same size of the eMMC).

Assuming the SD card is mounted at `/media/pi/BigOne`, then the commands are:

```shell
sudo dd if=/dev/mmcblk0 of=/media/pi/BigOne/mmcblk0_backup.img bs=4M status=progress
# These 3 might be not necessary, but anyway I'm adding them.
sudo dd if=/dev/mmcblk0boot0 of=/media/pi/BigOne/mmcblk0boot0_backup.img bs=4M status=progress
sudo dd if=/dev/mmcblk0boot1 of=/media/pi/BigOne/mmcblk0boot1_backup.img bs=4M status=progress
sudo dd if=/dev/mmcblk0rpmb of=/media/pi/BigOne/mmcblk0rpmb_backup.img bs=4M status=progress
```

## Creating and maintaining users

The commands to create the `gamer` user were:

```shell
# 1. Create the "gamer" user, with exactly that name.
sudo useradd -M gamer

# 2. Link it to /mnt/CURRENT_SAVE. This storage must exist by this point.
sudo ln -s /mnt/CURRENT_SAVE /home/gamer
```

Also, in order to change the password for the existing `root` and `pi` users:

1. `sudo passwd` for `root` user.
2. `GUI option: Start > Preferences > Raspberry Pi Configuration` for `pi` user.
    1. Button: `Change Password`.

The default password that comes with the supported image is: `Admin$2024`.
