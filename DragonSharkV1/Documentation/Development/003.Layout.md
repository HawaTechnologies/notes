# FileSystem(s)
Our filesystem is actually broken in 3 parts:

1. The core filesystem (/).
2. The current save (/mnt/CURRENT_SAVE).
3. The saves storage (/mnt/SAVES).

## Core filesystem
This is an ext4 system with, basically, the whole system. It contains:

1. The whole system and tools.
2. The current configurations, including:
	1. The paths to emulated games' ROMs.
	2. The paths to emulated games' SAVES (inside /mnt/SAVES).
	3. General configuration(s) of software (incl. RetroArch and EmulationStation).

Its size is like 12GB, and most likely a good amount of ROMs (for consoles like PlayStation) will not fit there.
## Current Save
The current save is a _public filesystem_. It's meant to be totally public and writable by the _currently executing game_. Nothing is audited there.

Also, `/mnt/CURRENT_SAVE` is symlinked as `/home/gamer`, since _that one_ is the user that will run games, and it might happen that games write in the local `$HOME` directory (or an inferred one, which will typically be `/home/gamer`).

Its size is like 20MB. More than enough for most games, since there are _no_ assets here. This implies another restriction (which is intentional / for user security): It's a very small amount so no caching of downloaded assets should occur here. Games should be _complete_ in content.

Emulated games (RetroArch, EmulationStation) do not use this directory at all. Only non-emulated games do.
## Saves Storage
This is where the storage for all the games is stores, being them emulated or not. Depending on the platform, these games' saves will be stored into:

- Atari 2600: `/mnt/SAVES/atari2600`.
- Atari 5200: `/mnt/SAVES/atari5200`.
- Atari 7800: `/mnt/SAVES/atari7800`.
- Atari Jaguar: `/mnt/SAVES/atarijaguar`.
- Atari Lynx: `/mnt/SAVES/atarilynx`.
- DOS Box: `/mnt/SAVES/dosbox`.
- SEGA Genesis: `/mnt/SAVES/genesis`.
- SEGA Game Gear: `/mnt/SAVES/gamegear`.
- SEGA Master System: `/mnt/SAVES/mastersystem`.
- SEGA CD: `/mnt/SAVES/segacd`.
- Nintendo (NES): `/mnt/SAVES/nes`.
- Nintendo (SNES): `/mnt/SAVES/snes`.
- Nintendo Gameboy Color: `/mnt/SAVES/gbcolor`.
- Nintendo Gameboy Advance: `/mnt/SAVES/gba`.
- Nintendo DS: `/mnt/SAVES/nds`.
- Nintendo 64: `/mnt/SAVES/n64`.
- MAME: `/mnt/SAVES/mame`.
- Sony PlayStation: `/mnt/SAVES/ps1`.
- NeoGeo CD: `/mnt/SAVES/neogeocd`.
- NeoGeo Pocket: `/mnt/SAVES/neogeopocket`.
- DragonShark (native games): `/mnt/SAVES/dragonshark`.

Please note that each DragonShark savefile can span up to 20mb.
