# FileSystem(s)
Our filesystem is actually broken in 3 parts:

1. The core filesystem (/).
2. The current save (/mnt/CURRENT_SAVE).
3. The saves storage (/mnt/SAVES).
## Core filesystem
This is an ext4 system with, basically, the whole system. It contains:

1. The whole system and tools.
2. The current configurations, including:
	1. The paths to emulated games' ROMs.
	2. The paths to emulated games' SAVES (inside /mnt/SAVES).
	3. General configuration(s) of software (incl. RetroArch and EmulationStation).

Its size is like 12GB, and most likely a good amount of ROMs (for consoles like PlayStation) will not fit there.
## Current Save
The current save is a _public filesystem_. It's meant to be totally public and writable by the _currently executing game_. Nothing is audited there.

Also, `/mnt/CURRENT_SAVE` is symlinked as `/home/gamer`, since _that one_ is the user that will run games, and it might happen that games write in the local `$HOME` directory (or an inferred one, which will typically be `/home/gamer`).

Its size is like 20MB. More than enough for most games, since there are _no_ assets here. This implies another restriction (which is intentional / for user security): It's a very small amount so no caching of downloaded assets should occur here. Games should be _complete_ in content.

Emulated games (RetroArch, EmulationStation) do not use this directory at all. Only non-emulated games do.
## Saves Storage
This is where the storage for all the games is stores, being them emulated or not. Depending on the platform, these games' saves will be stored into:

- Atari 2600: `/mnt/SAVES/atari2600`.
- Atari 5200: `/mnt/SAVES/atari5200`.
- Atari 7800: `/mnt/SAVES/atari7800`.
- Atari Jaguar: `/mnt/SAVES/atarijaguar`.
- Atari Lynx: `/mnt/SAVES/atarilynx`.
- DOS Box: `/mnt/SAVES/dosbox`.
- SEGA Genesis: `/mnt/SAVES/genesis`.
- SEGA Game Gear: `/mnt/SAVES/gamegear`.
- SEGA Master System: `/mnt/SAVES/mastersystem`.
- SEGA CD: `/mnt/SAVES/segacd`.
- Nintendo (NES): `/mnt/SAVES/nes`.
- Nintendo (SNES): `/mnt/SAVES/snes`.
- Nintendo Gameboy Color: `/mnt/SAVES/gbcolor`.
- Nintendo Gameboy Advance: `/mnt/SAVES/gba`.
- Nintendo DS: `/mnt/SAVES/nds`.
- Nintendo 64: `/mnt/SAVES/n64`.
- MAME: `/mnt/SAVES/mame`.
- Sony PlayStation: `/mnt/SAVES/ps1`.
- NeoGeo CD: `/mnt/SAVES/neogeocd`.
- NeoGeo Pocket: `/mnt/SAVES/neogeopocket`.
- DragonShark (native games): `/mnt/SAVES/dragonshark`.

Please note that each DragonShark savefile can span up to 20mb.
# Configurations for emulated games
This console supports all the previously mentioned consoles (save for DragonShark, which is the native support). While RetroArch can launch games from any specified path and store where the user pleases, EmulationStation is just an interface to it, divided by sections.

The sections are all of them defined in `/home/pi/.emulationstation/es_systems.cfg`. This file is an XML file with all the said entries, each matching the proper extensions and command lines.

Some insights are given by default:

- The default paths for the __ROMs__ is: `/media/pi/DATA`. Today that path _does not exist_ and can/should be changed in a future.
- The __LibRetro cores__ are stored in `/home/pi/.config/retroarch/cores`. All of them are listed here.
- The __RetroArch configurations__ are stored in `/home/pi/.config/retroarch/config`.
# Desirable features
Tools should be developed to:

1. Keep a tool to change either the ROMs directory or the configurations directory. Or both. This requires:
	1. Tracking (in a custom file like `/home/pi/.config/dragonshark/paths.cfg`) the current ROMs directory (starting with: `/media/pi/DATA`) and the current RetroArch configurations directory (starting with: `/home/pi/.config/retroarch/config`).
	2. Keep a template to generate, each time, the `/home/pi/.emulationstation/es_systems.cfg` file with the selection those paths.
2. Backup the saves directory to a path in a separate partition (the idea is that: unknown partitions under /media will be enumerated for this purpose).
	1. With the option to also: CLEAR the current saves directory.
3. Restore the saves directory from a path in a separate partition (same idea about unknown partitions), previously clearing the entire saves directory.

This is a `TODO`.
