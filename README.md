# Hawa - Complete Notes
This repository serves the sole purpose of tracking all the Hawa-related global notes. The intention of this is to track not the individual software components' documentations (they'll be detailed in their own repositories), but actually the console projects and/or the external elements (e.g. complementary applications, like the VirtualPad client).
## DragonShark (V1)
This is the first Hawa videogames console. It will be detailed under the DragonSharkV1/ directory.
## VirtualPad
This is the Hawa VirtualPad toolkit and protocol. It will be detailed under the VirtualPad/ directory.
